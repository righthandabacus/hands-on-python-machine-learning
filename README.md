# Hands-on Introduction to Python And Machine Learning

This is just yet another brief introduction to Python and machine learning. The target audience is secondary school students.

There are two parts:

1. Python tutorials --- I shamelessly modified the great tutorials prepared by [@ehmatthes](https://twitter.com/ehmatthes) and included them into this repo.
2. Machine learning --- includes some fundamental concepts, and some super simple examples and proofs that cannot be found easily on textbooks or internet.
