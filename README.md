# Hands-on Introduction to Python And Machine Learning

好似無乜有極簡單例子嘅 machine learning notes，所以整咗少少出嚟，隨 notes附送抄嘅 Python tutorials。對象係高中學生或者中二學生

This is just yet another brief introduction to Python and machine learning. The target audience is secondary school students.

There are two parts:

1. Python tutorials --- I shamelessly modified the great tutorials prepared by [@ehmatthes](https://twitter.com/ehmatthes) and included them into this repo.
2. Machine learning --- includes some fundamental concepts, and some super simple examples and proofs that cannot be found easily on textbooks or internet.
